Got it 👍 You want to implement a Blue-Green Deployment Strategy using Postgres + Enterprise Failover Manager (EFM), where you can take one node out for private (PVT) testing, validate a stable release, and then promote that validated node as the new master (green), while the old master (blue) becomes standby.

Here’s the solution design:


---

🔹 High-Level Concept

Blue Environment (Current Master & Standbys):
Active production cluster serving traffic.

Green Environment (Candidate Node):
A standby node is detached, upgraded/tested with the new release, and validated.

EFM Failover & Role Switch:
Once validated, EFM promotes the green node to Master.
Old blue master is reconfigured as a standby (or retired).



---

🔹 Deployment Steps with EFM

1. Current Setup (Blue Active Cluster):

Master Node → serves read/write traffic.

Standby Nodes → synced via streaming replication.

EFM monitors health & manages failover.



2. Prepare Green Candidate:

Pick one standby node.

Temporarily remove it from the EFM cluster (so failover won’t touch it).

Apply new release/config changes.

Run PVT (Private Validation Testing).



3. Validation Phase:

Test new schema, queries, and application compatibility on the green node.

Ensure replication lag is caught up if needed.



4. Switch to Green:

Promote the validated green node using EFM (efm promote).

Application traffic is switched to the new master (green).

Old master (blue) is converted into a standby and rejoined to EFM.



5. Stable Release Complete:

The new master (green) serves production traffic.

Failover mechanism remains intact via EFM.

🔹 Failover Considerations

EFM ensures that only the healthy promoted node becomes master.

Automated failover can still be enabled, but during cutover, you may prefer manual promotion to avoid unexpected switches.

If PVT fails → discard the green candidate and keep Blue as master.

🔹 Diagram

Here’s a conceptual flow:

Step 1: Current Production (Blue Active)
   ┌───────────────┐
   │   Master (Blue)│  <─ Application Traffic
   └───────┬───────┘
           │
   ┌───────┴──────────┐
   │ Standby 1 (Blue) │
   │ Standby 2 (Blue) │
   └──────────────────┘
         (EFM Cluster)

------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Take One Node Out for PVT (Green Candidate)
   ┌───────────────┐
   │   Master (Blue)│  <─ Application Traffic
   └───────┬───────┘
           │
   ┌───────┴──────────┐
   │ Standby 1 (Blue) │
   │ Standby 2 (Green - PVT Testing) │ ← Detached from EFM
   └──────────────────┘

------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Promote Green to Master
   ┌───────────────┐
   │   Master (Green) │  <─ Application Traffic
   └───────┬────────┘
           │
   ┌───────┴──────────┐
   │ Standby 1 (Blue) │
   │ Standby 2 (Old Master - Rejoined as Standby) │
   └──────────────────┘
         (EFM Cluster)

🔹 Benefits

Zero-downtime deployments with tested green candidates.

Rollback is easy: if green fails, blue remains master.

No risk to production during validation.

EFM automation ensures reliable failover.

👉 Shashank, do you want me to also create a professional architecture diagram (with color-coded Blue/Green nodes) that you can directly use in your Confluence/Docs, instead of just the ASCII flow?
