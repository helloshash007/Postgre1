Got it! Hereâ€™s a refined version with a brief overview:

Title: Transitioning from Jenkins to Ansible for Continuous Deployment Due to Audit Compliance

1. Introduction

Our deployment process initially relied on Jenkins for continuous deployment. However, due to audit and compliance concerns, we were advised to transition to an alternative approach. This document outlines the identified problem and the solution implemented using Ansible.

2. Problem Statement

Jenkins was found to have audit-related limitations, such as inadequate traceability, security concerns, and gaps in approval workflows. These issues made it unsuitable for continuous deployment in our environment.

3. Solution: Ansible-Based Deployment

To address compliance and security concerns, we implemented an Ansible-based deployment process. Ansible provides improved traceability, better control over approvals, and seamless integration with existing infrastructure while ensuring compliance with audit requirements.

4. Deployment Flow Overview

The deployment process now involves:

Validating change requests, package integrity, and Git versions.

Ensuring package ID verification before deployment.

Executing deployments through controlled Ansible playbooks.

Maintaining detailed logs for audit compliance.


5. Additional Checks and Enhancements

We have incorporated extra validation steps, security measures, and improved tracking to align with compliance requirements. This approach ensures a secure and auditable deployment pipeline.
