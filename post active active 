PostgreSQL does not support an active-active setup natively because it uses a primary-replica model for replication. However, you can achieve an active-active-like setup using third-party solutions. Here are a few options:

1. BDR (Bi-Directional Replication)

Description: BDR (developed by 2ndQuadrant, now part of EDB) is one of the best solutions for multi-master replication in PostgreSQL.

Features:

True active-active replication.

Conflict resolution mechanisms.

Low replication lag.


Use Case: Distributed applications requiring multiple writable nodes.


2. pglogical (Logical Replication)

Description: Logical replication can be used for partial or selective replication and can be configured to simulate active-active replication.

Features:

Fine-grained replication (table-level).

Custom conflict resolution.


Use Case: Multi-region setups where conflict resolution is handled at the application level.


3. Citus (Sharding and Distributed Transactions)

Description: Citus (by Microsoft) is an extension for PostgreSQL that enables distributed SQL for scaling reads and writes.

Features:

Sharding and parallel queries.

Can distribute writes to multiple nodes.


Use Case: High-throughput transactional systems.


4. Bucardo (Trigger-Based Replication)

Description: Bucardo is a replication system that uses triggers for data replication.

Features:

Asynchronous replication.

Custom conflict resolution.


Use Case: Legacy systems needing minimal database modifications.


5. Patroni + Etcd + HAProxy (Failover, Not True Active-Active)

Description: Patroni manages PostgreSQL clusters and provides automated failover.

Features:

Auto failover with etcd or Consul.

Read scaling with HAProxy or PgBouncer.


Use Case: High availability with fast failover.

Which One to Choose?

For true active-active: Use BDR (best option) or pglogical.

For distributed workloads: Use Citus.

For legacy replication needs: Use Bucardo.

For high availability (but not active-active): Use Patroni + HAProxy.


Do you have a specific requirement, such as handling conflict resolution, high availability, or performance?



Yes, EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) is one of the best solutions for achieving active-active replication in PostgreSQL. It is designed specifically for high availability, disaster recovery, and geographically distributed workloads.

Why Use EDB PGD for Active-Active Setup?

1. True Multi-Master Replication:

All nodes can handle both read and write operations.

Conflict resolution mechanisms ensure consistency.



2. High Availability & Fault Tolerance:

Automatic failover and self-healing clusters.

Can sustain node failures without losing availability.



3. Global Scale and Low Latency:

Optimized for geographically distributed deployments.

Reduces latency by directing queries to the nearest node.



4. Conflict Resolution:

Supports automatic conflict resolution strategies.

You can configure custom conflict resolution logic.



5. Seamless Application Integration:

Applications do not need to be modified significantly to use PGD.

Works with existing PostgreSQL tools and extensions.

How to Set Up EDB PGD for Active-Active

1. Install EDB PGD

Use EDB's package repositories to install PGD.

Ensure all nodes are running compatible PostgreSQL versions.



2. Initialize the Cluster

Set up multiple PostgreSQL nodes with PGD installed.

Use pgdctl or efm (Enterprise Failover Manager) to configure the cluster.



3. Configure Active-Active Replication

Enable bi-directional replication between nodes.

Define conflict resolution policies.



4. Monitor and Manage

Use EDB Postgres Enterprise Manager for monitoring.

Set up alerting and automated failover mechanisms.

Use Cases for EDB PGD

✅ Financial Systems → Low-latency global transactions.
✅ E-commerce & Retail → Multiple regional databases with consistent inventory.
✅ Government & Compliance → High availability for critical applications.
✅ IoT & Analytics → Distributed data ingestion and processing.
