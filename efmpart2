Here’s a polished and concise write-up for your Next Steps section:

Next Steps

1. Database Consolidation
Merge the smaller 1GB database into the primary database to optimize infrastructure usage. This strategic consolidation is expected to deliver cost savings of approximately $200K annually without impacting the performance of the main database.


2. Infrastructure Procurement
Provision 8 servers in Zone A and 2 servers in Zone B to support the upcoming environments. This setup will ensure high availability and fault tolerance.


3. Environment Setup & Testing
Configure new testing environments pointing to the newly provisioned database servers. A dedicated 7-day testing window will be initiated, during which all non-essential functionality testing will be temporarily paused to enable focused, interruption-free validation of the migration and performance.

Discussion Summary

1. Database Consolidation

Decision: Merge the smaller (~1GB) database into the main database.

Reason: Smaller DB is underutilized and consolidation will save ~$200K annually.

Impact: No performance degradation expected on the main DB.



2. PgBouncer Deployment

Action: Implement PgBouncer for efficient database connection pooling post-merge.

Benefit: Improved resource utilization and better connection handling.



3. Infrastructure Procurement

Requirement: Procure 8 servers in Zone A and 2 servers in Zone B.

Purpose: Support new environment deployment with zone-based redundancy.



4. Environment Setup & Testing Plan

Action: Point new environments to the consolidated DB servers.

Testing Strategy:

Initiate 7-day focused testing window.

Suspend all other functional testing during this period to ensure precise, uninterrupted validation.
