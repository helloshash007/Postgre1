Next Steps

1. Database Consolidation
Merge the smaller 1GB database into the primary database to optimize infrastructure usage. This strategic consolidation is expected to deliver cost savings of approximately $200K annually without impacting the performance of the main database.


2. Infrastructure Procurement
Provision 8 servers in Zone A and 2 servers in Zone B to support the upcoming environments. This setup will ensure high availability and fault tolerance.


3. Environment Setup & Testing
Configure new testing environments pointing to the newly provisioned database servers. A dedicated 7-day testing window will be initiated, during which all non-essential functionality testing will be temporarily paused to enable focused, interruption-free validation of the migration and performance.
