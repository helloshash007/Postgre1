PostgreSQL 14.17 (released on Feb 20, 2025) includes:

1. Fix for libpq Quoting Functions – PQescapeLiteral() and PQescapeIdentifier() now correctly respect string length parameters and handle invalid encoding more safely.


2. Fix for Partitioned Table Triggers – Resolves a crash issue when both AFTER UPDATE and AFTER DELETE triggers use transition tables in partitioned tables.



This release focuses on stability and bug fixes rather than performance improvements.


PostgreSQL 14.17 fixes issues in libpq quoting functions and prevents crashes with triggers on partitioned tables. It improves stability but does not directly impact query performance.
