Got it âœ… â€” if you donâ€™t want an agent and instead want to poll metrics directly from PostgreSQL, then the whole logic can be built around:

A polling scheduler (e.g. cron job, Python/Go script, or Airflow)

SQL queries against Postgres system views

Optional Linux commands (for OS-level stats if needed)

Store results in your monitoring DB / TimeSeries DB


Iâ€™ll break this down into categories of metrics â†’ queries/commands â†’ polling frequency â†’ logic to aggregate.


---

ðŸ”¹ 1. Connections & Sessions

Query active sessions:

SELECT datname, usename, application_name, state, 
       count(*) AS connections
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY datname, usename, application_name, state
ORDER BY connections DESC;

Query long running transactions:

SELECT pid, usename, application_name, datname, 
       now() - xact_start AS xact_duration, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state != 'idle'
  AND xact_start IS NOT NULL
  AND now() - xact_start > interval '5 minutes'
ORDER BY xact_duration DESC;

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 30s â€“ 1m


---

ðŸ”¹ 2. Database-Wide Stats

Transactions, deadlocks, temp files:

SELECT datname, xact_commit, xact_rollback, 
       blks_read, blks_hit, 
       tup_returned, tup_fetched, tup_inserted, tup_updated, tup_deleted,
       conflicts, deadlocks, temp_files, temp_bytes
FROM pg_stat_database
WHERE datname NOT IN ('template0', 'template1');

Logic: Store deltas between polls â†’ compute TPS/QPS.

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 1m


---

ðŸ”¹ 3. Query Performance (pg_stat_statements)

Enable once:

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;

Top queries by execution time:

SELECT dbid, userid, queryid, query,
       calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time,
       rows, shared_blks_hit, shared_blks_read, temp_blks_written
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

Logic: Poll periodically â†’ compute delta metrics (since pg_stat_statements is cumulative).

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 1â€“5m


---

ðŸ”¹ 4. Locks & Blocking

Who is blocked:

SELECT bl.pid AS blocked_pid, a.query AS blocked_query,
       kl.pid AS blocking_pid, ka.query AS blocking_query,
       a.wait_event_type, a.wait_event
FROM pg_locks bl
JOIN pg_stat_activity a ON bl.pid = a.pid
JOIN pg_locks kl ON bl.locktype = kl.locktype
JOIN pg_stat_activity ka ON kl.pid = ka.pid
WHERE NOT bl.granted;

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 30s (or faster if you want near real-time).


---

ðŸ”¹ 5. Replication Metrics

On primary (replication lag):

SELECT application_name,
       pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), replay_lsn) AS bytes_lag,
       now() - replay_timestamp AS time_lag
FROM pg_stat_replication;

On replica (apply delay):

SELECT (now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp()) AS apply_delay;

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 30s â€“ 1m


---

ðŸ”¹ 6. WAL Generation

WAL written per minute:

SELECT pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), '0/0') AS wal_bytes;

Logic: Take diff between two polls â†’ WAL churn (bytes/min).

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 1m


---

ðŸ”¹ 7. Autovacuum & Table Health

Dead tuples / vacuum history:

SELECT schemaname, relname, n_dead_tup,
       last_vacuum, last_autovacuum,
       last_analyze, last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC
LIMIT 20;

Bloat estimate (with pgstattuple):

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgstattuple;
SELECT relid::regclass AS table,
       approx_tuple_count, dead_tuple_percent, free_space_percent
FROM pgstattuple_approx('public.mytable');

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 10â€“30m


---

ðŸ”¹ 8. Checkpoint & Background Writer

SELECT checkpoints_timed, checkpoints_req, 
       buffers_checkpoint, buffers_clean, buffers_backend
FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;

Logic: Compute deltas â†’ measure checkpoint pressure & buffer usage.

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 5m


---

ðŸ”¹ 9. Config Drift

SELECT name, setting, unit, source, boot_val, reset_val
FROM pg_settings;

Logic: Compare current vs baseline JSON snapshot â†’ flag drift.

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 1h


---

ðŸ”¹ 10. OS / System Level (Linux Commands)

If you also want system stats (without agent, but via remote ssh):

CPU/Memory:

vmstat 1 2

Disk usage:

df -h

IO stats:

iostat -dx 1 2

Logic: Parse & store values in metrics DB.

ðŸ“Œ Polling frequency: every 1m


---

ðŸ”¹ Polling Workflow (Backend Logic)

1. Scheduler (cron/airflow/daemon) runs queries every N seconds/minutes.


2. Collect SQL results â†’ JSON.


3. Compute deltas for cumulative views (e.g., pg_stat_database, pg_stat_statements).


4. Push metrics into TimeSeries DB (Timescale/Prometheus/ClickHouse).


5. Frontend React pulls aggregated APIs (last 1m, 1h, 1d).

ðŸ”¹ Example Polling Script (Python + psycopg2)

import psycopg2, time, json

conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=postgres user=monitor password=xxx host=pg-host")

def poll_activity():
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("""
            SELECT datname, usename, state, count(*)
            FROM pg_stat_activity
            GROUP BY datname, usename, state;
        """)
        rows = cur.fetchall()
        return rows

while True:
    data = poll_activity()
    print(json.dumps({"timestamp": time.time(), "activity": data}))
    time.sleep(60)  # poll every minute


---

âœ… This way, you donâ€™t need an agent â€” everything is pull-based.


---

Do you want me to design a full SQL-based polling pipeline (with exact queries per table and how to compute deltas for time-series) so you can plug it directly into a backend (like FastAPI/Flask + TimescaleDB)?
