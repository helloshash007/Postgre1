Got it! Here's the EFM vs VCS comparison for PostgreSQL 14 in a plain, non-tabular formatâ€”easy to copy into a GitHub README or any plain text file:


---

EFM (Enterprise Failover Manager)

Type: Application-level failover tool

PostgreSQL Integration: Native support for PostgreSQL

Version Support: Officially supports PostgreSQL 14

Failover Mechanism: Monitors DB and promotes standby to primary

Fencing (STONITH): Basic support via shutdown scripts

Split-brain Handling: Uses witness node or majority quorum

Configuration Complexity: Simple, fast setup

Monitoring Scope: PostgreSQL processes, replication lag, availability

GUI/CLI: CLI & basic web interface

Dependency Management: Limited to PostgreSQL

Custom Scripting Support: Supports hooks/scripts

Cost: Free (comes with EDB or open source)

OS Support: Primarily Linux

Logging and Alerts: Basic

Performance Overhead: Minimal

Use Case: Simple PostgreSQL HA

Community & Support: Good support from EDB and community



---

VCS (Veritas Cluster Server)

Type: OS-level high availability (HA) cluster

PostgreSQL Integration: Requires custom agents or scripts

Version Support: Requires manual configuration for PostgreSQL 14

Failover Mechanism: Handles node and service-level failover

Fencing (STONITH): Advanced fencing mechanisms

Split-brain Handling: Sophisticated I/O fencing to prevent split-brain

Configuration Complexity: Complex configuration

Monitoring Scope: Complete node, network, and application stack

GUI/CLI: Full-featured CLI & Veritas Cluster Manager GUI

Dependency Management: Supports multiple service and resource dependencies

Custom Scripting Support: Extensive scripting and automation support

Cost: Licensed, commercial product

OS Support: Cross-platform (Linux, Unix, Windows)
