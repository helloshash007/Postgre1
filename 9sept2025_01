Nice — let’s design a production-ready Postgres monitoring tool (React front end + Node.js backend) that polls Postgres (no agent) and gives EDB-like observability: real-time charts, health checks, alerts, query diagnostics, and capacity planning. I’ll give you a clear front-end wireframe & component plan, backend architecture, DB schema & storage recommendations, polling/collector logic (with sample SQLs), API design, alerting rules, scaling & security tips, and small code sketches to get started.

1 — High level architecture

Collectors (Node.js) — stateless workers that poll Postgres instances on schedule, normalize metrics, write to time-series storage and push realtime updates to clients.

Time-series storage — TimescaleDB (Postgres extension) or InfluxDB/Prometheus + long term Postgres for metadata. I recommend TimescaleDB (compatible with Postgres SQL for queries).

API server (Node.js / Express) — REST endpoints for historic queries, metadata; WebSocket/Server-Sent Events (SSE) for realtime.

Frontend (React + charting lib) — dashboards, alerts UI, SQL diagnostics pages. Use component library (MUI/AntD or Tailwind+Headless UI) and chart lib (Recharts, Chart.js, or ECharts).

Auth & RBAC — JWT + roles; integrate LDAP/SSO (SAML/OIDC) in enterprise.

Optional: Job queue (BullMQ/Redis) for scheduled tasks & backfills; Prometheus exporter and Grafana compatibility if you want integrations.


2 — Key metrics to collect (grouped)

Connection & activity

active connections, max_connections usage (count, by DB + user + app)

connection churn (new connections / sec)


Queries & performance

long running queries (pg_stat_activity: state = 'active' and query_start)

top 50 slow queries (by total_time, calls)

average/percentile query latency (p50/p95/p99)


Resource usage

CPU, memory (from host) — obtained via remote SSH/agentless commands or node exporter if available (polling might need SSH to run vmstat/free).

I/O waits, read/write bytes (pg_stat_bgwriter, pg_stat_io if extension available)


Buffers / Cache

pg_buffercache (hit ratio if extension installed) — buffer hit ratio calculations

cache miss trends


Autovacuum / bloat

autovacuum stats (pg_stat_all_tables, last_autovacuum)

table bloat estimation (sample SQL provided below)


Replication

WAL shipping/replication lag (pg_stat_replication: replay_lag, write_lag)

timeline, standby status


Checkpoint & WAL

checkpoint frequency/time, last_checkpoint_time (pg_stat_bgwriter)

WAL write rate (pg_wal), wal_files, wal_size growth


Locks & Deadlocks

lock counts, blocking queries, deadlock count (pg_locks + pg_stat_activity)


Disk

table & index size (pg_total_relation_size), disk free on data directory (via SSH polling)


Health

postgres uptime, version, config drift (selected params)

connection fail rate & authentication failures


3 — Suggested SQL queries / commands (polling-friendly)

Run as a monitoring user with minimal privileges (pg_stat* views are fine).

Active connections counts:

SELECT datname, usename, application_name, state, count(*) AS cnt
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE pid <> pg_backend_pid()
GROUP BY datname, usename, application_name, state;

Long running queries:

SELECT pid, usename, datname, now() - query_start AS duration, state, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active' AND now() - query_start > interval '5 seconds'
ORDER BY duration DESC
LIMIT 50;

Top queries by total time (requires pg_stat_statements extension):

SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, stddev_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 50;

Table size and growth:

SELECT
  schemaname, relname,
  pg_total_relation_size(schemaname || '.' || relname) AS total_bytes,
  pg_relation_size(schemaname || '.' || relname) AS table_bytes,
  pg_indexes_size(schemaname || '.' || relname) AS index_bytes
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY total_bytes DESC
LIMIT 100;

Replication lag:

SELECT pid, application_name, client_addr, state,
  pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), replay_location) AS bytes_behind,
  now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp() AS time_behind
FROM pg_stat_replication;

Autovacuum / vacuum stats:

SELECT schemaname, relname, last_autovacuum, last_autoanalyze, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC
LIMIT 100;

Checkpoint & bgwriter:

SELECT checkpoints_timed, checkpoints_req, checkpoint_write_time, checkpoint_sync_time, buffers_checkpoint, buffers_clean, checkpoints_timed + checkpoints_req AS total_checkpoints
FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;

Estimate bloat (simplified example using pgstattuple or query from blog posts). You can run this periodically or on-demand per table.

Disk free on host (agentless): run df -h /var/lib/pgsql/data via SSH/cron and parse.

4 — Polling strategy (no agent)

Collector workers: Node.js processes that connect direct to Postgres over the network. Keep them stateless; use a scheduler (node-cron or Bull job) to run metric collection jobs.

Collection frequency tiers:

Real-time / high-frequency (5s–15s): active connections, long queries, replication lag

Medium (30s–1m): pg_stat_statements snapshot, bgwriter, checkpoint metrics

Low (5–15m): table size, autovacuum history, bloat estimate


Connection pooling: use a dedicated pool per monitored instance (pg-pool). Limit concurrency to avoid load on monitored DBs.

Backoff: if a monitored DB is slow, reduce poll frequency temporarily.

Batching: fetch aggregated metrics in single queries rather than many small queries when possible.


5 — Storage model & schema (TimescaleDB recommended)

Use hypertables for timeseries metrics: metrics(metric_time, instance_id, metric_name, value, tags JSONB)

Example schema:


CREATE TABLE metrics (
  metric_time timestamptz NOT NULL,
  instance_id text NOT NULL,
  metric_name text NOT NULL,
  value double precision,
  tags jsonb
);
SELECT create_hypertable('metrics', 'metric_time');

Store raw samples + rollups:

Raw data retention: 7–30 days (depending on scale)

1m aggregated (mean, max, min, p95) for 90 days

1h aggregated for 2+ years


Store events/alerts separately:


CREATE TABLE alerts (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  instance_id text,
  metric_name text,
  level text,
  threshold double precision,
  observed_value double precision,
  first_seen timestamptz,
  last_seen timestamptz,
  labels jsonb,
  note text
);

6 — API design (Express + WebSocket)

REST endpoints

GET /api/instances — list monitored instances (metadata)

POST /api/instances — add instance (host, port, user, tags)

GET /api/metrics?instance=...&metric=...&from=...&to=...&agg=1m — historic metrics

GET /api/top-queries?instance=...&since=... — top slow queries

GET /api/active-connections?instance=... — current connections snapshot

GET /api/tablesize?instance=...&limit=50 — table sizes


Realtime

WebSocket topic ws://.../realtime:

subscribe {type: "metrics", instance:"db1", metrics:["connections", "replication_lag"]}

server pushes JSON {metric_time, instance_id, metric_name, value, tags}



Auth

POST /auth/login -> JWT

Middleware validates JWT for API routes and WS handshake


7 — Front end: wireframe & component plan (React)

Use React + Vite/Next.js (for SSR optional). Component library: MUI or AntD for rapid development, Tailwind for fully custom style.

Top-level pages

1. Overview / Global dashboard

Grid of cards: total instances, unhealthy instances, average CPU, average connection usage, alerts count

Map or list of instances with status (up/down)



2. Instance detail (primary page)

Top row: instance header (host, version, uptime, role), quick actions (connect via psql, run diag)

Charts row: CPU, Memory, Disk, Connections (real-time charts)

Queries row: Top slow queries table + expand to show EXPLAIN sample

Replication row: replication lag and state for each replica

Tables row: table sizes + top growth

Events / alerts timeline

Controls: Retention, collection frequency overrides, on-demand diagnostics



3. Queries / Diagnostics

Search queries, filter by DB/user/app

Ability to run EXPLAIN ANALYZE (if allow) in a sandbox — or provide instructions to run



4. Alerts & Rules

List rules (create/edit), history, ack/unack

Create rule wizard with conditions, duration, thresholds, severity, notification channels (email, Slack, webhook)



5. Settings / Instances

Add / edit monitored instances (connection test)

RBAC / users

Data retention settings, storage usage




UI components (React)

TopNav, InstanceCard, MetricChart (wraps chart lib), TimeRangePicker, MetricTable, AlertRuleForm, AlertsList, ConnectionsHeatmap, QueryList, SQLPreviewModal.

Use React Query (TanStack Query) to fetch & cache REST data and to manage stale/realtime updates.

Use WebSocket hook: useRealtimeSubscription(topic, cb) to stream metrics.


Wireframe suggestions (quick)

Left: vertical nav (Overview, Instances, Queries, Alerts, Settings)

Main: responsive grid; time range selector and instance dropdown top right

Use sparklines inside cards and a large main chart per row


8 — Sample frontend skeleton (React + hooks)

// App.jsx (simplified)
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Overview from './pages/Overview';
import Instance from './pages/Instance';
import Nav from './components/Nav';

function App(){
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Nav />
      <main>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Overview />} />
          <Route path="/instance/:id" element={<Instance />} />
          <Route path="/alerts" element={<Alerts />} />
        </Routes>
      </main>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

Use react-query to fetch metrics and a WebSocket hook for realtime updates.

9 — Sample backend collector sketch (Node.js/Express)

Use pg package for DB connection

Use pg-pool with small connection pool per instance

Scheduler: node-cron for periodic tasks or job queue BullMQ (Redis)


Pseudo:

// collector.js
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ /* instance creds */ });

async function collect() {
  const client = await pool.connect();
  try {
    const r = await client.query(`SELECT now() as ts, count(*) as conns FROM pg_stat_activity`);
    // write to metrics table (Timescale) or push to API
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}
setInterval(collect, 15000); // every 15s

10 — Alerts engine

Rule types:

Threshold (eg connection > 90% of max_connections for 3m)

Rate (eg error_count increases > X / minute)

Anomaly detection (simple moving average + stddev alerting or ML later)


Engine:

Evaluate rules periodically against aggregated metrics table (1m rollups)

On rule trigger create alert row, notify via webhook/Slack/email

Support silence/ack/auto-resolve



11 — Security & operational tips

Use a read-only monitoring role with access to pg_stat* plus pg_buffercache & pg_stat_statements if enabled.

Use TLS for Postgres connections; restrict monitoring IPs via firewall.

Rate-limit collectors to avoid extra load.

Ensure collectors run from a secure network (VPC) close to DB to reduce latency.

Secrets: store DB credentials in HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / environment vars encrypted.

Build health endpoints for collectors and API for orchestration and monitoring of your monitoring tool.


12 — Scaling & reliability

Keep collectors stateless and horizontally scalable. Use per-instance scheduling so each instance is polled by one worker in a distributed setup (use Redis locks to avoid duplicate collectors).

Use TimescaleDB for high ingest; use continuous aggregates for rollups.

Use backpressure: if DB reports high numbackends or high load, collectors reduce frequency.

Metrics sharding by instance_id for reads.


13 — Optional advanced features

Explain collection: capture plan for slow queries using EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) sampled (not for every query).

Query fingerprinting: normalize queries via pg_stat_statements to group similar plans.

Maintenance suggestions: auto-detect index candidates, vacuum thresholds.

Report & capacity planning: growth forecasts from historical sizes.

Integrations: Grafana, Prometheus exporter, PagerDuty, Slack.


14 — Roadmap & milestones (practical sprint plan)

1. MVP (2–4 weeks)

Collector that polls basic metrics (connections, long queries, table sizes) every 15s/1m and writes to TimescaleDB.

Express API: metrics endpoints + instance CRUD.

Simple React Overview + Instance detail with charts and WebSocket realtime.

Basic auth (JWT) and monitoring role.



2. Phase 2 (4 weeks)

pg_stat_statements support, top N slow queries, replication metrics.

Alerts engine, simple UI to create rules + Slack/webhook notifications.



3. Phase 3 (4+ weeks)

Anomaly detection, explain plan snapshots, bloat detection, RBAC/SSO, backfills, scalability hardening.




15 — Final checklist & quick wins

Use TimescaleDB for time-series storage to keep stack Postgres-based.

Use pg_stat_statements and pg_buffercache extensions — they give high value.

Limit collector query impact: prefer aggregated queries, not too many fine-grained calls.

Provide an “on-demand diagnostic” button in UI that runs deeper checks only when pressed.

Implement retention & continuous aggregate policies early.



---

If you want, I can:

draft the exact DB schemas and Timescale continuous aggregate SQLs,

produce a prioritized backlog (epics + tickets), or

create the initial Node.js collector + Express API starter repo and a React scaffold with the Overview and Instance pages.


Which of those would you like next?
