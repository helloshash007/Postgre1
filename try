Python code to run query ' select slot_name, active, restart_lsn, confirmed_flush_lsn, pg_size_pretty(pg_wal_lsn_diff(ph_current_wal_lsn(), confirmed_flush_lsn)) AS target_lag from pg_replication_slots where slot_type= 'logical'  and through warning when ever result target_lag is not 0 bytes and paste result with corresponding row   and run copy.py  we need to run every 2 hour  

We dont want to cron and also it should start automatically if stopped due certain issues 

We need to write logs continuously 

We also need to if select * from pg_replication_slots active is t if it's f then throught alert with slot name and also compare the confirmed_flush_lsn by running the query twice and if it's not changing the. Through alert 

We need to run copy script only if lag is not getting zero in an 2 hour and also through error and we have to run copy script only twice a day max then through error replication is not working fine 

And also log that confirmed flush is changing if it is changing when we compare it 

We need to have gap of 5 hours in executing copy script as well

Can we print is all slots have zero lag as well


Also run the copy script daily at 10 am server time 

Need to warning for any lag in log 

Can you just give me change info to warning 

If flush lsn is not changing then also trigger alert rather then infor

If all slots are active the. It should mention all slots are active other wise it should through error if it's f


I need copy.py execution time to be printed in log
