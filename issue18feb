In PostgreSQL, a view can become "corrupted" if its underlying tables or columns change, making it invalid. You can check for invalid views using the system catalog tables and functions.

1. Check for Invalid Views

Run the following query to check for views that are currently invalid:

SELECT c.relname AS view_name, n.nspname AS schema_name
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
WHERE c.relkind = 'v' 
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_depend d
    JOIN pg_rewrite r ON d.objid = r.oid
    WHERE r.ev_class = c.oid
);

If this query returns any rows, those views might be invalid due to missing dependencies.

2. Try to Refresh the View (for Materialized Views)

If you are using materialized views, try refreshing them to check for errors:

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name;

If an error occurs, the view is likely broken.

3. Check View Definition for Invalid References

To inspect view definitions and manually verify if any referenced tables or columns are missing:

SELECT relname AS view_name, pg_get_viewdef(oid, true) AS view_definition
FROM pg_class
WHERE relkind = 'v';

Look for missing tables or columns in the output.

4. Try to Recreate the View

If you suspect corruption, try recreating the view:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS 
SELECT * FROM some_table;  -- Adjust as per your schema

If this fails due to missing dependencies, you'll get an error message pointing to the problem.

5. Use pg_views to Identify Broken Views

You can also query pg_views to examine view dependencies:

SELECT schemaname, viewname, definition FROM pg_views;

Look for missing or incorrect references.

Would you like a script to automate this check across multiple views?
