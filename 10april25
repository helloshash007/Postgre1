The failover time for EDB EFM (Enterprise Failover Manager) to switch from a primary to a secondary node typically falls in the range of:

5 to 10 seconds (default behavior)

However, this time can vary depending on several factors:

Factors influencing failover time:

1. efm.properties configuration values:

efm.cluster.polling.interval – how often EFM checks the node status.

efm.shutdown.timeout – how long it waits before forcefully shutting down a node.

efm.node.timeout – how long a node can be unresponsive before it's considered down.

efm.failover.timeout – time EFM waits before triggering failover.



2. Network latency between EFM agents and nodes.


3. Database recovery time on the secondary node (especially if crash recovery is needed).


4. Synchronous vs Asynchronous replication – synchronous setups can take longer if the standby isn't caught up.


5. Load on the secondary node at the time of failover.



Example Scenario:

With these typical values:

efm.node.timeout=10
efm.cluster.polling.interval=2
efm.failover.timeout=10

Failover would take around 10–15 seconds under ideal conditions.

If you're aiming for faster failover, you can tweak these values, but be careful not to trigger false positives due to transient issues.
