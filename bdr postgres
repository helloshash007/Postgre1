To achieve hot-hot architecture in PostgreSQL, you aim for active-active high availability (HA), where two or more nodes can simultaneously handle read-write workloads with strong consistency and conflict-free replication.

PostgreSQL does not support native multi-master replication (i.e., true hot-hot) out of the box, but it can be implemented using third-party tools and careful design.

✅ Options to Achieve Hot-Hot (Active-Active) PostgreSQL Architecture

1. BDR (Bi-Directional Replication)

Developed by 2ndQuadrant (now part of EDB).

Provides multi-master replication (up to 48 nodes).

Built for geo-distributed databases.

Supports conflict detection/resolution.

Near real-time replication.


Pros:

True hot-hot.

Writes allowed on all nodes.

Asynchronous but near real-time.


Cons:

Complex setup.

Not open-source (BDR 3+ is commercial).



---

2. Pglogical + Custom Conflict Handling

Logical replication extension for PostgreSQL.

Supports replication between nodes, but not multi-master by default.

You can build bi-directional replication manually with pglogical and resolve conflicts via triggers/custom logic.


Pros:

Open-source.

Fine-grained control.


Cons:

Conflict handling is manual.

Not suitable for high-write contention workloads.



---

3. Citus (by Microsoft)

Turns PostgreSQL into a distributed database.

Supports distributed tables across worker nodes.

Writes go through a coordinator node, but with partitioning and sharding you can simulate hot-hot behavior.


Pros:

Horizontally scalable.

Built-in HA and parallelism.


Cons:

Coordinator is a single point for writes (somewhat limits true hot-hot).

Use case must fit distributed model (i.e., sharded datasets).



---

4. CockroachDB (PostgreSQL-compatible)

Not PostgreSQL, but PostgreSQL wire-compatible.

Built for distributed SQL with global ACID transactions.

True multi-region hot-hot support.


Pros:

Built-in active-active across data centers.

Horizontal scalability.

Postgres-like syntax.


Cons:

Not actual PostgreSQL.

Some Postgres features missing or behave differently.

⚠️ Considerations for Hot-Hot PostgreSQL

1. Conflict Resolution: Writes from multiple nodes can conflict. Tools like BDR handle it automatically, but others need custom logic.


2. Latency: Multi-region or cross-data center setups introduce replication lag and consistency trade-offs.


3. Consistency Models: Understand trade-offs between eventual consistency and strong consistency.


4. Application Design: Must be aware of replication lag, conflict potential, and retry logic.

✅ Practical Recommendation

Use Case	Tool	Why?

Production-grade hot-hot	BDR	True multi-master with support
Custom setup, limited budget	pglogical	Build bi-directional setup manually
Large distributed workloads	Citus	Scalable with partitioned writes
Want Postgres-like + strong active-active	CockroachDB	Distributed SQL with full HA

Example: BDR Architecture

+-----------------+       +-----------------+
|     Node A      | <-->  |     Node B      |
| (Read/Write)    |       | (Read/Write)    |
+-----------------+       +-----------------+
       ↑                         ↑
       |     Bi-directional      |
       |      Replication        |
       ↓                         ↓
+-----------------+       +-----------------+
|     Clients     |       |     Clients     |
+-----------------+       +-----------------+
