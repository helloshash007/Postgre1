Thanks for the context, Shashank. Based on your issue—importing data in a transactional batch (truncate + import) leading to table-level locks and application downtime (1–3 minutes)—you're right to rethink the approach.

Here are best-practice solutions for minimizing or eliminating downtime while still ensuring data consistency and near real-time sync:

✅ Best Solutions to Avoid Table Lock & Enable Real-time Sync

Option 1: Use Staging Tables + Swap Pattern (Zero Downtime)

How it works:

1. Create a staging copy of each table (same schema).


2. Import data into the staging table (no impact on users).


3. Use a transactional ALTER TABLE RENAME to swap staging table with the live table:

BEGIN;
ALTER TABLE live_table RENAME TO live_table_old;
ALTER TABLE staging_table RENAME TO live_table;
COMMIT;


4. Drop live_table_old later asynchronously or archive it.



Pros:

No truncate = no lock.

Import is fully isolated from the live table.

Downtime < 1 sec during rename.


Cons:

Requires doubling storage temporarily.

May need to manage sequences/foreign keys carefully.

Option 2: Logical Replication for Real-Time Sync

If your data is coming from another Postgres system:

Steps:

Use PostgreSQL Logical Replication or Debezium to replicate changes in near real time.

Configure replication slots on source DB and publish table changes.

Apply changes using subscribers on your application DB.


Pros:

Real-time.

No locking or downtime.

PostgreSQL-native.


Cons:

Works well for insert/update/delete — not ideal if source is a CSV or flat file.



---

Option 3: Use MERGE/UPSERT Instead of TRUNCATE + INSERT

Instead of truncating the table:

Use INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE or the SQL MERGE statement in Postgres 15+.

This avoids locks and keeps the table live during import.


Example:

INSERT INTO target_table (id, col1, col2)
SELECT id, col1, col2 FROM staging_table
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE
SET col1 = EXCLUDED.col1, col2 = EXCLUDED.col2;

Pros:

No downtime.

Maintains live reads.


Cons:

Slightly more complex logic.

Performance depends on table/index size.



---

Option 4: Partition Swapping (If Tables Are Partitioned)

If your group tables are partitioned by time or ID:

1. Load into a new partition.


2. Detach old partition.


3. Attach new partition.



Pros:

Real-time, minimal lock.

Built-in to Postgres partitioning.


Cons:

Needs partitioned table setup.

Not always suitable for all schemas.



---

Option 5: Use Foreign Table (FDW) + Materialization

Import into a remote/staging DB using FDW (Foreign Data Wrapper).

Create materialized views on main DB that pull from staging.

Refresh on demand or using triggers.


Pros:

Decoupled loading.

Easy to monitor.


Cons:

Complexity.

Might not work for high-performance OLTP apps.

🧠 Recommendation Based on Your Case

Since:

You're importing full datasets (truncate + insert).

Users are blocked due to truncate locks.

You need minimal downtime / real-time experience.


➡️ Use Option 1: Staging Tables + Rename Pattern

It's the most robust and simple zero-downtime pattern.

Combine with MERGE logic if partial imports become necessary.



---

🔁 Optional Enhancements

Use triggers to audit sync success/failure.

Automate via Ansible + Jenkins or Python if syncing from external source.

Use batch import tools like COPY for fast loads.

Maintain sync timestamp/version control for partial reloads.

Would you like an Ansible-based implementation for Option 1 or a PostgreSQL script example for any of these solutions?
