If you're seeing an Access Share Lock for a query in PostgreSQL 14 but there are no other queries running, here are some steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. Check for Blocking Locks

Run the following query to check if there are any blocking locks:

SELECT pid, age(clock_timestamp(), query_start) AS duration, usename, state, wait_event, wait_event_type, query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE wait_event IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY query_start;

Look for any other sessions that might be blocking the current query.

If there is a blocking session, you can terminate it using:

SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<blocking_pid>);


2. Check for Long-Running Transactions

If an old transaction is holding a lock, it might be preventing the query from executing. Check for long-running transactions:

SELECT pid, age(now(), xact_start) AS duration, state, query 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active' OR state = 'idle in transaction';

If a transaction has been running for a long time, consider committing or rolling it back:

SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<pid>);


3. Check for Unused or Orphaned Locks

List all current locks:

SELECT locktype, relation::regclass, mode, granted, pid 
FROM pg_locks 
WHERE NOT granted;

If you find an unused lock stuck, restarting PostgreSQL might be necessary.


4. Vacuum and Analyze the Table

If the table is experiencing autovacuum issues, you might need to run:

VACUUM ANALYZE <table_name>;

Check if autovacuum is running with:

SELECT * FROM pg_stat_progress_vacuum;


5. Restart PostgreSQL (if necessary)

If all else fails and the lock persists without any visible blocking sessions, restarting the PostgreSQL service might be necessary:

systemctl restart postgresql

Or for Docker-based PostgreSQL:

docker restart <postgres_container_name>

Next Steps

If the issue keeps occurring, check triggers, indexes, or foreign keys that might be unexpectedly locking the table.

Monitor the database locks using pg_stat_activity to catch blocking sessions earlier.
